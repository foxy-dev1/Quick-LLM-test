# Quick-LLM-test


A small project that help you quickly test your LLM's using drag and drop like different modules to know which prompt works and what temperature to choose (Langflow like functionality)

Current -> Simple chat interface to test LLM using Gemini-API (without memory)

Future plans -> integrate drop and drag RAG , integration with more LLM's like GPT-4o, Llama , Local LLMs. All with memory .
